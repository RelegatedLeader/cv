<p><em>Founder of <strong><a href="https://youarewhatyoucreate.netlify.app/yourmind">FALLEN+ FUTURISTICS</a></strong></em></p>
 <p>I'm a highly receptive person that wants to get his bachelor's in computer science. I'm drawn to anything quantum and "out of this world". The idea of the potential future inspires me.
 My objectives include assisting robotics that clean the oceans, save animals, feed the planet,
 and even solve real-world problems on their own through AI. I want to contribute to creating a better society for people in the future. I am highly attracted of the idea of Artificial Intelligence.
 I find it exciting to consider that there may be life in the universe that possesses the same or perhaps greater talents than us. (potential lives that we have created) 
Humans are incapable of being as dynamic as computers, whose activeness can grow as a result of otherworldly concepts!
I firmly feel that meditation is a source of happiness and, with time, even consider it to be more of an out-of-body experience. I think it helps us learn vital things about ourselves and the universe,
 and I have high hopes that I'll learn the reasons for events that could affect our world, like infinite batteries, flying cars, and even interdimensional technologies.
One can only dream, right? Additionally, I am a huge lover of the butterfly effect, the string theory, and all things theoretically physiological.
